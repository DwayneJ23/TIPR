## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
This was my first time developing an app, so learning the various features took sometime. One of the challenging aspects was learning how to save user data. Once I figured this out, the next challenging task was accessing the system time to remember data from a previous launch over a limited time period (less than 10 mins in this case).
